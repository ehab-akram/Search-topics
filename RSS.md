# Definition

- RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication" (though it has historically also stood for "Rich Site Summary" or "RDF Site Summary").

- It is essentially a format---built on XML---that websites use to publish summaries or full details of their new content automatically.

- The file contains structural elements (like the **title**, **description**, **publication** **date**, **link**, and **metadata**) for each piece of content.

- This standardization means that **regardless of the website's design, the feed can be read by any compliant RSS reader**.

# Why Do We Use RSS Feeds?

- **Centralized Content and Efficiency**

  - RSS feeds offer an efficient way to keep up with multiple websites in one centralized location without having to manually check each site.

  - This is particularly valuable for busy professionals, researchers, or anyone who follows a wide range of sources.

- **User Control vs. Algorithm-Driven Content**

  - Unlike social media, where algorithms determine what you see, RSS gives users **complete control** over the sources they subscribe to.

  - This means you can avoid the "noise" of algorithmic feeds and get a straightforward, chronological list of updates from your favorite websites.

- **Privacy and Minimal Data Sharing**

  - Subscribing via RSS does **not require** giving away personal information.

# What is the XML File

## Definition 

- XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar in concept to HTML but **designed to store data rather than to display it**.

- These Xml file make the data both **self-descriptive** and **hierarchical**, meaning that the structure and relationships between data elements are clear.

- **Unlike HTML, which has a fixed set of tags, XML allows you to define your own tags that are relevant to your data,** making it very flexible for many different applications.

## Example

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">
